Here's a sample `README.md` based on your folder structure. This is suitable for a typical TypeScript-based Node.js backend project with modular structure and features like authentication, chat, middleware, and database schemas:

---

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

This project is organized in a modular and scalable way using TypeScript. Below is a high-level explanation of each directory and file:

### 📂 `src/`

Main source directory.

---

### 📁 `config/`

Contains configuration files.

- **cloudinary.ts** – Configures Cloudinary for image uploads and media handling.

---

### 📁 `core/`

Core application logic and utilities.

- **di/** – Dependency injection setup.
- **events/** – Application-level event handlers.
- **http/** – HTTP helpers (controllers, routes, etc.).
- **utils/** – Utility/helper functions used across the project.

---

### 📁 `db/`

Database schemas and models.

- **chatSchema.ts** – Schema/model for chat-related data.
- **userSchema.ts** – Schema/model for user-related data.
- **schema.ts** – Centralized or shared database schema definitions.
- **index.ts** – Entry point for exporting database connections or models.

---

### 📁 `features/`

Contains domain-specific logic grouped by feature.

- **auth/** – Authentication logic (routes, controllers, services).
- **chat/** – Chat-related feature logic.
- **user/** – User-related operations.

---

### 📁 `middleware/`

Custom middleware functions for request/response handling.

- **authMiddleware.ts** – Handles user authentication validation for protected routes.

---

### 📁 `types/`

Custom TypeScript types and interfaces.

- **index.ts** – Consolidated type exports used across the project.

---

### 📄 `.env`

Environment variables file for sensitive configurations.

---

### 📄 `drizzle.config.ts`

Configuration file for [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), used to define and migrate schemas.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and provide necessary values.

3. **Run the project**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Database migration (if using Drizzle)**

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```
